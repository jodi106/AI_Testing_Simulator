## Description

The goal of this international team project is the development of a simulated testing environment based on an already existing open-source driving simulator for autonomous driving AIs. The key features are the following: An easy to use scenario Editor to build simulate short traffic situations to verify if the AI under test is able to safely handle them. A tool which is able to record and process the sensor data which is produced by the simulated cars sensors during the test scenarios. A rudimentary driving AI which can be customized to do several dangerous or faulty behaviors which will be used to check wether sets of test cases are able to detect the dangerous or faulty behavior.

## Description

The goal of this international team project is the development of a simulated testing environment based on an already existing open-source driving simulator for autonomous driving AIs. The key features are the following: 
1. [ScenarioEditor](https://github.com/jodi106/AI_Testing_Simulator/releases/tag/ScenarioEditor_v1.0): An easy to use OpenSCENARIO format (.xosc) scenario Editor to build short traffic situations to verify if the AI under test is able to safely handle them. 
2. [runnerTool](https://github.com/jodi106/AI_Testing_Simulator/releases/tag/runnerTool_v1.02): A tool which is able to run and evaluate multiple OpenSCENARIO scenarios in Carla.

## How to Setup

### How to setup up the Scenario Editor
1. Download the latest ScenarioEditor release [from here](https://github.com/jodi106/AI_Testing_Simulator/releases/latest)
2. Extract the .zip file to a directory of your choice
3. Run the AI_Testing_Simulator.exe file

General Instructions on how to use the Scenario Editor can be found [here (TODO)](https://example.com/)

### How to setup Carla 0.9.13 (Windows)
We suggest using the Package Installation 0.9.13 for convenient and quick setup. Future verions might cause conflicts (not tested).
1. Create a new python environment
2. Read the ["Before you begin"](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.13/start_quickstart/) section in the Carla documentation to check prerequisits.
3. Install python modules "pygame numpy" and "carla" to your python environment. 
   ```
   pip3 install --user pygame numpy
   pip3 install carla
   ```
4. Download and unzip the package version 0.9.13 from [Github](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/blob/master/Docs/download.md).
5. Use runnerTool for convenient scenario running.

Refer to the official [Carla Documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.13/start_quickstart/) for more detailed instructions and Linux setup.

##### If you are using Conda and have problems with shapely and arcade try the following:
```
conda install -c conda-forge shapely
pip install arcade
```

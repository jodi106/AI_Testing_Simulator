Context
###########

The development of autonomous driving technology is one of the most rapidly evolving fields in the transportation industry. The need for a comprehensive simulation environment that can test and validate the capabilities of autonomous driving AI is crucial for the safe deployment of these systems on public roads. 
With the increasing demand for autonomous vehicles, the need for a simulation environment that can accurately model real-world scenarios and test the AI's ability to handle them is more important than ever. 
The "Autonomous Driving Simulation Environment" project aims to address this need by providing a simulation platform that allows for the creation of custom traffic scenarios and the testing of autonomous AI in a controlled and repeatable manner. By offering an intuitive Traffic Network Builder and an API that facilitates communication between the simulation and an external AI agent the project hopes to provide a valuable tool for the autonomous driving industry to advance the technology and ensure its safe deployment.

Goal
###########

The goal of this international team project is the development of a simulated testing environment based on an already existing open-source driving simulator for autonomous driving AIs. The key features are the following: An easy to use scenario Editor to build simulate short traffic situations to verify if the AI under test is able to safely handle them. A tool which is able to record and process the sensor data which is produced by the simulated cars sensors during the test scenarios. A rudimentary driving AI which can be customized to do several dangerous or faulty behaviors which will be used to check wether sets of test cases are able to detect the dangerous or faulty behavior.

Description
###########

The goal of this international team project was the development of a Traffic Network Builder that allows for the on-the-fly creation of maps in Opendrive 1.4 format. These maps can then be used in simulators like Carla or other projects based on it.

1. `The OpenDRIVE Standard <https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/opendrive/>`__ - A standardized format for representing road networks, used to create maps for autonomous driving simulations.
2. `Carla Driving Simulator <https://carla.org/>`__ - An open-source autonomous driving simulator that enables researchers and developers to experiment with various algorithms in a realistic environment.
3. `AI Testing Simulator <https://github.com/jodi106/AI_Testing_Simulator/>`__ - The previous internation collaboration which this project is based on
